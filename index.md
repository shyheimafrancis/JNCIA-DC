This self-paced course provides instruction on data center switching using Juniper products. This course lays the foundational knowledge to understand a data center built upon an IP fabric, but does not include Ethernet VPNâ€“Virtual Extensible LAN (EVPN-VXLAN) architecture.

> While Juniper sergest that this is an entry level exam, I would beg to differ. Theyre are some more intermidiate and more advanced consepts...

Before taking taking the training and exam here are a few of my prerequisites 

- Basic understanding and operating the Junos
- Basic understanding Layer 2 Switching, VLANs and Security
- Basic understanding Data Center Routing Protocols BGP/OSPF
